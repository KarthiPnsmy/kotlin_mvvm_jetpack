## Kotlin + MVVM + Jetpack + Dagger2/Koin

This is a simple experimental Android application developed to evaluate two major dependency framework in Android ecosystem namely **Dagger2** and **Koin**. This application also leverages from Jetpack architectural components such as *LiveData, LifeCycle, Navigation Component, Room, View Model, and Coroutines*.

Here are the details of DI implementation,

1. ***[without_di](https://github.com/KarthiPnsmy/kotlin_mvvm_jetpack/tree/without_di) -> This branch has the source code without any dependency injection library.***
2. [master](https://github.com/KarthiPnsmy/kotlin_mvvm_jetpack/tree/master) -> In this branch dependency injection implemented using Dagger2
3. [with_koin](https://github.com/KarthiPnsmy/kotlin_mvvm_jetpack/tree/with_koin) -> In this branch dependency injection implemented using Koin.

May be comparing master and with_koin will give you an overview of complexity, implementation and developer friendliness of these two different dependency injection library.
